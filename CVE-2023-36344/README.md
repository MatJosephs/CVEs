# Version: Diebold Nixdorf Vynamic View Console 5.3.1
# CVE : CVE-2023-36344

Introduction
=================
An issue in Diebold Nixdorf Vynamic View Console v.5.3.1 and before allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary code via not restricting the search path for required DLLs and not verifying the signature. The following DLLs allow DLL Hijcaking:

VERSION.DLL

WINMM.DLL

WSOCK32.DLL

MSVCR100.DLL

WINMMBASE.DLL

USERENV.DLL

CRYPTBASE.DLL

URLMON.DLL

IEUTIL.DLL

SRVCLI.DLL

NETUTILS.DLL

IPHLPAPI.DLL

USP10.DLL

WININET.DLL

Proof of Concept
=================
An attacker can create a malicious DLL, rename it to one of the above and place it in the folder where the executable attempts to load the DLL. When the program is executed, the malicious DLL runs in the context of the benign program.
