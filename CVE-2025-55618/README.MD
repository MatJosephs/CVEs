# CVE : CVE-2025-55618

Introduction
=================
In Hyundai Navigation App STD5W.EUR.HMC.230516.afa908d, an attacker can inject HTML payloads in the profile name field in navigation app which then get rendered. The payloads are limited to 14 characters, so this limits the opportunity for XSS.

Proof of Concept
=================
An attacker can inject a HTML payload in the Profile name field in navigation app. An attacker must navigate to Settings > Profile and click the name of the profile and replace the previous name with a payload such as `<h1>Alexa</h1>` which then gets rendered in the Profile page.
Similarly, if the attacker injects a `<script>` tag, the name of the user will be invisible, suggesting that `<script>` tags are rendered as well. However, due to the 14-character limit, exploiting the XSS is impractical, unless a character limit bypass is identified.
